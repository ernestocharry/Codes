Hi!		:) 


This repository has many of my codes developed in my academic career 
as well as by my interests. 

Computational Methods in Physics and Detector Simulation has the codes 
learn in my Bachelor Degree (Universidad Nacional de Colombia) and at the 
Masterâ€™s Degree (Universidad Nacional de Colombia). There are some 
reports in their folders. 

COVID-19 and Text Analysis has really simple codes: to watch the official 
data of the pandemic and to learn how to analyze a text in Python.
